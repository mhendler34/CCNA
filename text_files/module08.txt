**NETOWRKING**:ok
To perform end-end comms Network Layer performs __ basic functions:4
FUNCTION 1, End devices must be configured with IP for ID to network, __ __ __:addressing end devices
FUNCTION 2, The Network Layer __ PDU from Transport layer into a __:encapsulates packet
The encapsulation process is performed by the __ of the IP packet:source
FUNCTION 3, The Network Layer provides __ to direct packets to destination host on another network:routing
The role of the router is to __ the __ path to a destination host:select best
Each router a packet passes on its way to the destination is a called, a __:hop
FUNCTION 4, Network Layer __ the packet if the destination IP within the header matches its own:de-encapsulates
Network Layer Protocols specify the packet __ & __ used to carry data from one host to another:structure processing
IP encapsulates data (transport layer segment) by adding an __ __:ip header
the IP Header is used to deliver the packet to the __ __:destination host
The process of encapsulating data layer by layer enables services to __ & __ without affecting other layers:develop scale
IP addressing information remains the __ from the time the packet leaves __ until it arrives at __:same source destination
except when translated by __ __ __:network address translation
IP was designed as a protocol with __ __:low overhead
These are the basic characteristics of IP, __, __ __, __ __:connectionless best effort media independent
There is no __ with the destination established before sending data packets:destination
Meaning, no dedicated end-end connection is created by IP before sending data, __:connectionless
Cannot guarantee that packet will be delivered without errors, __ __:best effort
IP is inherently __ because packet delivery is not __:unreliable guaranteed
__ means that IP does NOT have capability to manage & recover from undelivered packets:unreliable
IP operation is __ of the __ carrying the data:independent medium
IP packets can be carried as __ signals over copper, __ signals over fiber or __ signals over wireless:electrical optical radio
The OSI model __ __ layer is responsible for preparing IP packet for transmission over comms medium:data link
There is ONE MAJOR characteristc of MEDIA that Network Layer considers, __ __ of the __ that medium can transport:maximum size pdu
(ACRONYM) MTU:maximum transmission unit
The __ __ layer passes the __ up to the __ layer:data link mtu network
Process of splitting up packet when forwarding, is called, __:fragmentation
__ packets cannot be fragmented by the router, only __ packets can:ipv6 ipv4
**IPv4**:ok
SIGNIFICANT fields in IPv4 Header:ok
Contains 4-bit value set to 0100 that ID this an as IPv4 packet, __:version
Version, contains __-bit value of __ that ID this an IPv4 packet:4 0100
The __ __ field contains 8-bit used to determine priority of each packet:differentiated service
DiffServm contains __-bit field used to determine __ of each __:8 priority packet
8-bit field that is used to limit the lifetime of a packet, _ _ _:time to live
TTL, contains __-bit field that is used to __ the __ of a __:8 limit lifetime packet
This field is used to ID the next level protocol, __:protocol
Protocol, this field is used to the ID the next level __:protocol
This is used to detect corruption in the IPv4 header, __ __:header checksum
Header Checksum, used to detect __ in the IPv4 __:corruption header
Contains 32-bit value that represents the source IPv4 address in packet, __ __ __:source ipv4 address
the source IPv4 address is always a __ address:unicast
Contains 32-bit value that represents the destination IPv4 address, __ __ __:destination ipv4 address
the destination IPv4 address can be a __ __ or __ address:unicast multicast broadcast
Limitations of IPv4, address __, no end-end __, increased network __:depletion connectivity complexity
**IPv6**:ok
Improvements that IPv6 provide, increased __, improved packet __, eliminates __:address handling nat
SIGNICANT fields in IPv6 Header:ok
Contains 4-bit value set to 0110 that ID this an as IPv6 packet, __:version
Version, contains __-bit value of __ that ID this an IPv6 packet:4 0110
8-bit field is equivalent to DiffServ in IPv4, __ __:traffic class
This 20-bit field with the same flow label receive same handling, __ __:flow label
16-bit field indicates the length of data portion, (doesnt include length of IPv6 header) __ __:payload length
8-bit field is equivalent to Protocol field in IPv4, _ _:next header
8-bit field replaces TTL in IPv4, __ __:hop limit
128-bit field identifies the sending host, __:source
128-bit field identifies the receiving host, __:destination
A host can send a packet to __, __ host or __ host:itself local remote
The __ __ is a device that can route traffic to other networks:default gateway
On WINDOWS the commands, __ __ or __-_ can display HOST routing table:route print netstat -r
The ROUTING TABLE stores 3 types of entries, __ network, __ networks, __ __:directly remote default route
The network routes entries are active router interface, __-__ networks:directly connected
The network route entries are connected to other routers, __ __:remote networks
Routers learn about __ __ either by being explicitly configured, or exchanging route information:remote networks
Gateway of Last Resort is known as __ __:default route
The __ __ is used when there is no better option:default route
Routes that are manually configured, __ __:static routes
Appropriate for small network & when there are no redundant links, __ __:static routes
Allows routerss to automatically learn about remote networks, __ __:dynamic routing
Common CISCO Router source codes:ok
CISCO Command show routing table, __ __ __:show ip route
Directly connected Local Interface IP address, __:L
Directly connected network, __:C
Static route manually configured by ADMIN, __:S
OSPF, __:O
EIGRP, __:D
