**IPv6**:ok
Customer network has IPv6 connection to ISP & access content found on internet over IPv6, __ __:native ipv6
3 migration techniques for IPv6, __ __, __, __:dual stack tunneling translation
Allows IPv4 IPv6 to coexist on the same network segment, __ __:dual stack
Devices that run both IPv4 IPv6 protocol stacks simultaneously, __ __:dual stack
__ & __ are for transitioning to native IPv6 & only be used where __:tunneling translation needed
Transporting IPv6 packet over IPv4 network, __:tunneling
IPv6 packet is encapsulated in IPv4 packet, __:tunneling
Allows for IPv6 enabled-devices to comms w/IPv4 enabled-devices, __:translatiion
The technique for this IPv6 to IPv4 translations is known as _ _ _ _:network address translation 64
***IPv6 Addressing Formats***:ok
IPv6 addresses are __ bits:128
IPv6 addresses are written as __ values:hexadecimal
Every __ bits is represented by a __ value for a total of __ hexadecimal values:4 hexadecimal 32
IPv6 addresses have __ 16-bit segments, or __ hextets:8
A hextet refers to __ hexadecimal values:4
RULE 1, __ leading __:omit zeroes
RULE 2, __ colon:double
Double Colon can replace any single, __ string of one or more __ consisting of all __:contiguous hextets zeroes
If address has more than one contiguous string of 0000, bes practice is use double colon on __ __:longest string
If the strings are equal, best practice is to use Double Colon on __ string:first
***Unicast, Multicast, & Anycast***:ok
IPv6 Address uniquely identifies an interface on IPv6 enabled device, __:unicast
IPv6 Address is used to send single IPv6 packet to multiple destinations, __:multicast
IPv6 Address is ANY IPv6 unicast address that can be assigned to multiple devices, __:anycast
Anycast IPv6 Address is __ IPv6 __ address that can be assigned to multiple devices, __:any unicast
Unlike IPv4, IPv6 does not have a __ address:broadcast
The network portion of the IPv6 Address is called the __ __:prefix length
The prefix length can range from __ to __:0 128
The recommended prefix length for LANs is __:/64
/64 is strongly recommended because __ __ __ uses 64bits for the interface ID:stateless address autoconfiguration
Host portion of IPv6 is called the __ __:interface ID
IPv6 Address uniquely identifies an interface on IPv6 enabled device, __:unicast
IPv6 Unicast Address Types, __ __, _-_, __, __ __, __ __, __ __:global unicast link-local loopback unspecified address unique local embedded ipv4
Unlike IPv4 Devices that only have a __ address:single
IPv6 addresses typicalls have __ __ addresses:2 unicast
1st IPv6 UNICAST address, __ __ __ :global unicast address
2nd IPv6 UNICAST Address, __ __ __:link-local address
(ACRONYM) GUA:global unicast address
(ACRONYM) LLA:link-local address
These are unique, internet routable addresses, __ __ __:global unicast address
Required for every IPv6 enabled device, __ __ __:link-local address
Used to communicate with other devices on the same local link, __ __ __:link-local address
With IPv6 the term link refers to a __:subnet
Confined to a single link, not routable beyond the Link (subnet) _ _ _:link-local address
IPv6 global unicast address (GUAs) are globally __ & __ on the IPv6 internet:unique routable
(ACRONYM) ICANN:internet committee for assigned names and numbers
(ACRONYM) IANA:internet assigned numbers authority
__ allocates IPv6 Address blocks to the 5 __:icann rir
Currently, only GUA with the first 3 bits of _ _ _ or __/_ are being assigned:001 2000/3
A (GUA)global unicast address has 3 parts, __ __ __, __ _, __ _:global routing prefix subnet id interface id
The network portion of IPv6 ADDR that is assigned by ISP is _ _ _:global routing prefix
It is common for ISP to assign a global routing prefix of __ to its customers:/48
The area between the Global Routing Prefix & Interface Id, is the __ __:subnet id
The size of the __ __ __ determines the size of the __ __:global routing prefix subnet id
Equivalent to host portion in IPv4, __ __:interface id
The term Interface ID is used because a single host may have __ interfaces, each having __ or __ IPv6 ADDR:multiple one more
Unlike IPv4, in IPv6 all __ and all __ host addresses can be assigned:0 1
All-1s can be used because __ addresses are not used in IPv6:broadcast
All-0s can be used but is reserved as a __ address & only assigned to __:anycast routers
Enables a device to comms with other IPv6 devices on same link & only that link (subnet) _-_ _:link-local address
Packets with a source or destination __ cannot be __ beyond the link from which the packet originated:lla routed
__ is not a requirement, but every IPv6 enabled device must have an __:gua lla
If LLA is not __ configured, the device will __ create it own __ w/OUT comms with a __ server:manually automatically lla dhcp
IPv6 ADDR LLA are in the __ range:fe80/10
the /10 indicates the first 10 bits are _ _ _ _  _ _ _ _  _ _ _ _  _ _ _ _:1111 1110 10xx xxxx
The first hextet has a range of __ to __ (binary): 1111 1110 1000 0000 1111 1110 1011 1111
The first hextet has a range of __ to __ (hex):fe80 febf
1.) __ use the __ to neighbor router to send __ __:routers lla routing updates
2.) __ use the __ of the __ __ as the default-gateway:hosts lla local router
Typically it is the __ or the router, NOT the __ that is used as the default gateway:lla gua
**12.5 - DYNAMIC ADDRESSING for IPv6 GUA**:ok
For the GUA, _ _ _, a device obtains IPv6 ADDR dynamically through _ _ _ _ _:global unique address internet control message protocol v6
IPv6 routers periodically send out __ __ messages every 200 seconds to all IPv6 enabled devices on network:icmpv6 ra
An __ message will also be in response to a host sending an __ __ message, which is a request for an RA message:ra icmpv6 rs
RS messages are sent to all __ __ by hosts requesting addressing information:ipv6 routers
RA messages are sent to all __ __:ipv6 nodes
CISCO Command, (config#) enable router as IPv6 router, __ __-__:ipv6 unicast-routing
The ICMPv6 RA message is a __ to a device on how to obtain an GUA:suggestion
ICMPv6 RA messages include the following:ok
This tells the device which network it belongs to __ __ & __ __:network prefix prefix length
This is an IPv6 LLA, the source IPv6 Address of the RA message, _ _ _:default gateway address
These are the addresses of the DNS servers & domain name, _ _ & _ _:dns addresses domain name
There are 3 Methods for RA messages:ok
METHOD 1, "I have everything you need (prefix, prefix length, default gateway" __:slaac
METHOD 2, "Here is my info but you need other info like DNS from DHCPv6 Server" __ w/ __ __ __:slaac stateles dhcpv6 server
METHOD 3, "I can give you default gateway. You need to ask stateful DHCPv6 Server for other info", _ _ (_ _):stateful dhcpv6 no slaac
****METHOD 1 - SLAAC****:ok
__ is a method that allows a device to create its own __ without the service of __:slaac gua dhcpv6
Using SLAAC, devices rely on the __ __ messages of the local routers to obtain necessary info:icmpv6 ra
With SLAAC By __, RA message suggests the receiving device use info in RA to create is own __ __:default ipv6 gua
With SLAAC, The services of a __ __ are not required:dhcpv6 server
SLAAC is __, which means there is __ __ __ that allocates GUAs:stateless no central server
With SLAAC, the __ device use the info in the RA message to __ it own __:client create gua
With SLAAC, 2 parts of the address is created as follows:ok
With SLAAC, This is advertised in the RA message, __:prefix
With SLAAC, This uses the EUI-64 process or generates a random 64-bit number, __ __:interface id
Step #1, the __ sends an RA message with the __ for the __ __:router prefix local link
Step #2, the __ uses __ to obtain a __ from the RA message & __ its own __ __:pc slaac prefix creates interface id
****METHOD 2 - SLAAC & Stateless DHCPv6****:ok
METHOD 2, A router interface can be configured to send a __ __ using __ & STATELESS __:router advertisment slaac dhcpv6
METHOD 2, The RA message __ devices use the following information:suggests
METHOD 2, (RA INFO) #1 __ to creates it own IPv6 __:slaac gua
METHOD 2, (RA INFO) #2 The router __, which is the RA __ __ __, as the default gateway:lla source ipv6 address
METHOD 2, (RA INFO) #3 A stateless __ __ to obtain other information such as __ __ __ & __ __:dhcpv6 server dns server address domain name
METHOD 2, A stateless DHCP server distributes __ __ __ & __ __:dns server address domain names
METHOD 2, A stateless DHCP server __ __ __ GUAs:does not allocate
METHOD 2, Step #1, The __ sends an __ to all __ __, "I need addressing information":pc rs ipv6 routers
METHOD 2, Step #2, The __ sends an __ message to all __ __ "Here is prefix, prefix-length & default gateway):router ra ipv6 nodes
METHOD 2, Step #2, The router sends an RA message to all ipv6 nodes, "Here is __, _ _ & _ _ ):prefix prefix length default gateway
METHOD 2, Step #3, The __ sends a __ __ message to all __ __:pc dhcpv6 solicit dhcpv6 servers

NOTE** The __ __ address can only be dynamically obtained from the __ __:default gateway ra message
NOTE** The __ or __ __ __ does NOT provide the default gateway address:stateless stateful dhcpv6 server
****EUI-64 Process vs Randomly Generated***:ok
When the RA message is either __ or __ with __ __, the client must generate its own __ __:slaac slaac stateless dhcpv6 interface id
The Client knows the __ portion of the address from the __ message, but must generate it own __ __:prefix ra interface id
The Interface ID can be created using either the __-__ process or a __ __ 64-bit number:eui-64 randomly generated
Step #1, The __ sends an RA Message:router
Step #2, The __ uses the __ in the __ message & uses either __-_ or __ 64-bit # to __ an __ __:pc prefix ra eui-64 random generate interface id

QUESTION 1, Dynamic Addressing Method for GUA rely solely on contents of RA message for addressing:slaac
QUESTION 2, Dynamic Addressing Method for GUA rely solely on DHCPv6 server for addressing _ _:stateful dhcpv6
QUESTION 3, Dynamic Addressing Method for GUA IPv6 Config from RA & request DNS from DHCPv6 Server __ & __ __:slaac stateless dhcpv6
****12.6 - DYNAMIC LLA****:ok
All IPv6 Devices must have an __:lla
Windows will typically use the same method for both SLAAC created GUA & LLA:ok
Cisco Routers __ create an IPv6 LLA whenever a GUA is assigned to the interface:automatically
By Default, Cisco Routers use the _-_ process to generate interface ID for all LLA:eui-64 
A drawback to dynamically assigned LLA is its __ __ __:long interface id
Recall that an LLA must be __ only on that __ or __:unique link network
It is common to __ configure LLA:statically
Serial Interfaces on Routers __ __ have MAC address:do not
For Serial Interfaces on Routers, CISCO IOS uses the MAC addr of 1st available __ __:ethernet interface
****12.7 - IPv6 MULTICAST****:ok
Used to send a single packet to one or more destinations (multicast group) is a __ __:multicast address
Multicast Address is used to send a __ packet to __ or __ destinations (__ __):single one more multicast group
IPv6 Multicast Address have the PREFIX __:ff00/8
IPv6 Multicast Addresses can ONLY be __ addresses not __ addresses:destination source
There are 2 types of IPv6 Multicast Address, __-__ & __ __:well-known solicited node
IPv6 Multicast Addresses that are ASSIGNED, __-__:well-known
ASSIGNED Multicast Addresses are __ for __ groups or services:reserved predefined
ASSIGNED Multicast Address is a __ address used to reach a __ of devices running a common __ or __:single group protocol service
There are 2 Common IPv6 ASSIGNED Multicast Groups, __-__ and __-__:all-nodes all-routers
This is the multicast group that all IPv6 Enabled devices join, __-__ group:all-nodes
All-nodes multicast group address, __:ff02 double colon 1
A packet sent to this group is __ & __ by all IPv6 __ on link:received processed interfaces
This has the same effect as a __ address in IPv4:broadcast
This is a multicast group that all routers join, __-__:all-routers
Router joins this group when it is enabled an IPv6 router using the __ __-__ global config command:ipv6 unicast-routing
A packet send to this group is __ & __ by all IPv6 __ on the link:processed received routers
A __ __ multicast address is similar to the all-nodes multicast address:solicited nodee
The ADVantage of a solicited node address is that its __ to a special __ __ __:mapped ethernet multicast address
This allows the __ __ to filter the __ by examining the __ ADDR WITHOUT sending it to the __ __:ipv6 process
This examination of MAC addr allows the device to see if it is intended __ of the __ __:target ipv6 packet
