**NETWORKING**:ok
To perform end-end comms Network Layer performs __ basic functions:4
FUNCTION 1, End devices must be configured with IP for ID to network, __ __ __:addressing end devices
FUNCTION 2, The Network Layer __ PDU from Transport layer into a __:encapsulates packet
The encapsulation process is performed by the __ of the IP packet:source
FUNCTION 3, The Network Layer provides __ to direct packets to destination host on another network:routing
The role of the router is to __ the __ path to a destination host:select best
Each router a packet passes on its way to the destination is a called, a __:hop
FUNCTION 4, Network Layer __ the packet if the destination IP within the header matches its own:de-encapsulates
Unlike (OSI layer 4) __ Layer, which manages the data __ between __ running on each __:transport transport processes host
Network Layer Protocols ( _& __) specify the packet __ & __ used to carry data from host to host:ipv4 ipv6 structure processing
IP encapsulates data (transport layer segment) by adding an __ __:ip header
the IP Header is used to deliver the packet to the __ __:destination host
The process of encapsulating data layer by layer enables services to __ & __ without affecting other layers:develop scale
IP Header is examined by __ _ devices (i.e. router) as it travels across the network to its destination:layer 3

There is ONE MAJOR characteristc of MEDIA that Network Layer considers, __ __ of the __ that medium can transport:maximum size pdu
(ACRONYM) MTU:maximum transmission unit
The __ __ layer passes the __ up to the __ layer:data link mtu network
The __ layer then determines how __ packets can be:network large
Process of splitting up packet when forwarding, is called, __:fragmentation
A router may have to fragment an IPv4 packet when forwarding to medium with smaller __:mtu

the destination IPv4 address can be a __ __ or __ address:unicast multicast broadcast
Limitations of IPv4, address __, no end-end __, increased network __:depletion connectivity complexity
