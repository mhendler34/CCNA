**ADDRESS RESOLUTION**:ok
There are 2 primary addresses assigned to a device on an Ethernet LAN, __ & __:mac ip
MAC Address, aka, __ address is used for __ to __ communication on the __ __ __:physical nic nic same ethernet network
IP address, aka, __ address used to send packet from __ device to __ device, on same or remote network:logical source destination
Ethernet __ ADDR are used to deliver the __ __ frame with the __ IP packet from __ to __ on the same __:mac data link encapsulated nic nic network
If the destination IP ADDR is on the same network, the __ MAC address will be that of the __ device:destination destination
If the destination IP ADDR is on a remote network, the destination MAC will be the __ __:default gateway
Routers examine the __ IPv4 ADDR to determine the best __ to __ the IPv4 packet:destination path forward
When the router receives the Ethernet Frame, it _-__ the Layer __ information:de-encapsulates 2
Using the __ IPv4 ADDR, the router determines the __-__ device:destination next-hop 
& then __ the IPv4 packet with the new __ __ frame for the outgoing interface:encapsulates data link
Along each link in a path, an __ __ is encapsulated in a __:ip packet frame
The frame is __ to the data link technology that is associated with that __, (i.e.Ethernet):specific link
If the next-hop device is the final destination, the destination MAC ADDR will be that of the device's __ __:ethernet nic
How are IP ADDR of IP packets in data flow associated with MAC ADDR, IPv4 __ or IPv6 __ __ __:arp icmpv6 neighbor discovery
**ARP**:ok
When a device sends Ethernet Layer 2 frame, it has 2 ADDR, __ __ & __ __:destination mac source mac
If the destination IP ADDR is on the same network, the __ MAC address will be that of the __ device:destination destination
If the destination IP ADDR is on a remote network, the destination MAC will be the __ __:default gateway
For IPv4 packets, MAC-IP matching is done with _ _ _:address resolution protocol
For IPv6 packets, MAC-IP matching is done with _ _ _:icmpv6 neighbor discovery
ARP provides 2 basic functions:ok
ARP FUNCTION 1, __ __ ADDR to __ ADDR:resolving ipv4 mac
ARP FUNCTION 2, __ a __ of __ to __ address mappings:maintaining table ipv4 mac
**ARP FUNCTIONS**:ok
When Packet is sent to data link layer to be __ in Ethernet Frame:encapsulated
The device refers to a __ stored in __ to the find the __ address that is mapped to the __ address:table memory mac ipv4
This table is stored temporarily in __ memory & is called the ARP __ or ARP __:RAM table cache
If packet destination IPv4 is on SAME network as source IPv4 addr, devices searches __ table for __ IPv4 addr:arp destination
If packet destination IPv4 is on DIFFERENT network as source IPv4, device search __ table for IPv4 of __ __:arp default gateway
If device located IPv4 in its ARP table, its corresponding __ addr is used as the __ MAC address in the frame:mac destination
If device DOES NOT locate IPv4 in arp cache, devices sends an __ __:arp request
**ARP REQUEST**:ok
Sent when device needs to know MAC that is associated with IP & DOES NOT have entry in arp table, __ __:arp request
ARP messages are encapsulated direclty within __ __: ethernet frame
There is no __ __ in arp requests:ipv4 header
ARP REQUEST is __ in an Ethernet Frame with the following __ information:encapsulated header
ARP REQUEST destination MAC address, __-__-__-__-__-__:ff-ff-ff-ff-ff-ff
ARP REQUEST source MAC address is MAC address of __ of the ARP request:sender
ARP REQUEST TYPE FIELD is ___:0x806
Because ARP requests are __, they are flooded out __ ports, except __ port:broadcasts all receiving
__ Ethernet NICs on LAN process the broadcasts:all
All Ethernet NICs must deliver ARP request to __ __ for processing:operating system
__ device must __ the ARP REQUEST to see if the __ IPv4 ADDR matches its __:every process target own
A Router (wil/will not) __ forward the broadcasts out other interfaces:will not
Only __ device on the LAN will have an IP that matches the target IP in the ARP request:1
All other devices (wil/will not) __ relpy:will not
**ARP REPLY**:ok
__ the device w/the target IPv4 ADDR associated with ARP request will __ with an __ __:only respond ARP reply
The ARP REPLY is __ in the Ethernet Frame using the following __ information:encapsulated header
ARP REPLY destination MAC address is MAC address of __ of ARP __:sender request
ARP REPLY source MAC address is MAC address of __ of ARP __:sender reply
ARP REPLY TYPE FIELD is __:0x806
__ the device that originally sent the ARP REQUEST will receive the __ ARP REPLY:only unicast
After the ARP REPLY is received, the device will add the __ ADDR & __ ADDR to its __ __:ipv4 mac arp table
Packets destined for that IPv4 ADDR can now be __ in frames using it __ MAC ADDR:encapsulated corresponding
If no device responds to the ARP REQUEST, the packet is __, b/c a frame cannot be created:dropped
Entries in the ARP Table are __ __:time stamped
Each Device uses an ARP __ __ to remove ARP entries that have not been used for specified amount of time:cache timer
**ARP in Remote COMMS**:ok
When destination IPv4 is NOT on same network, source device needs to send the frame to its __ __:default gateway
The default gateway is the __ of the __ __:interface local router
When source device has packet w/IPv4 on remote network, it will __ that packet in a __ using the __ MAC ADDR of the __:encapsulate frame destination router
The IPv4 ADDR of the default gateway is stored in the IPv4 __ of the host:configuration
When host creates a packet for a destination, it __ the __ IPv4 ADDR with its own IPv4 ADDR:compares destination
If the destination host is not on the same network, source checks its __ __ for an entry with IPv4 ADDR of the __ __:arp table default gateway
If there is not an entry for default gateway, source uses the __ __ to determine the __ __ of the __ __:arp process mac address default gateway
COMMAND CISCO, display ARP table _ _ _:show ip arp
COMMAND WINDOWS, display arp table __ -_:arp -a
**ARP Issues**:ok
As a __ frame, an ARP REQUEST is __ & __ by every device on the LOCAL network:broadcast received processed
With a Large network, lots of devices all accessing the network at the same time could case some __ in performance:reduction
A threat actor could use ARP __ to perform an ARP __ __:spoofing poisoning attack
This technique is used by a threat actor to reply to an __ __ for an __ __ that belongs to another device:arp request ipv4 address
The threat actor sends an __ __ with its own __ __:arp reply mac address
The __ of the ARP reply will add the wrong __ __ to its __ __ & send these packets to the threat actor:receiver mac address arp table
DAI:dynamic arp inspection
enterprise level switches use _ _ _ to mitigate arp poisoning attacks:dynamic arp inspection
**ICMPv6 NEIGHBOR DISCOVERY**:ok
IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol is referred to as __ or ___:nd ndp
ND provides __ __, __ __ & __ services:address resolution router discovery redirection
ND uses __ to do this:ICMPv6
ICMPv6 ND uses __ types of messages to perform address resolution, router discovery & redirection:5
These messages are __ __, __ __, __ __, __ __, __:neighbor solicitation neighbor advertisement router solicitation router advertisement redirection
__ __ & __ __ are used for address resolution:neighbor solicitation neighbor advertisement
__ __ & __ __ are used for router discovery & SLAAC:router solicitation router advertisement
__ is used to notify router of better __-__ selection:redirection next-hop
ICMPv6 Neighbor Solication messages are sent using special Ethernet & IPv6 __ addresses:multicast
__ addresses allow Ethernet NIC of receiving device to determine if msg is for __ without involving the __:multicast itself os
