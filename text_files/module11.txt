***IPv4  ADDRESSING***:ok
**11.1 - IPv4 Address Structure**:ok
**11.2 - IPv4 Unicast, Broadcast, Multicast**:ok
Refers to one device sending a message to one other device in one-one comms, __ transmission:unicast
A unicast packet has a destination IP ADDR that is a __ ADDR which goes to a __ recipient:unicast single
A source IP ADDR can only be a __ ADDR, b/c the packet can only originate from a __ source:unicast single
IPv4 UNICAST host ADDR are in the range of _._._._ to _._._._:1.0.0.1 223.255.255.255
Single host to send a single packet to a selected set of hosts that subscribe to multicast group:multicast
Multicast messages __ traffic:reduce
A multicast packet is a packet with a destination IP ADDR that is a __ address:multicast
IPv4 has reserved the _._._._ to _._._._. address range as multicast:224.0.0.0 239.255.255.255
Hosts that receive particular multicast packets are called __ __:multicast clients
Each multicast group is represented by a __ IPv4 multicast destination address:single
Routing protocols such as _ use multicast transmissions:ospf
Refers to a device sending a message to all the devices on network in one-all comms, __ transmission:broadcast
A broadcast packet has a destination IP ADDR with all __ in the __ portion:1 host
IPv4 uses __ packets, however, IPv6 __ __ use broadcast packets:broadcast does not
A broadcast packet must be processed by __ devices the SAME __ domain:all broadcast
Identifies all hosts on the SAME network segment, is called a __ __:broadcast domain
A broadcast my be __ or __:directed limited
Sent to all hosts on specific network is a __ broadcast:directed
A limited broadcast is sent to _._._._:255.255.255.255
By default, routers __ __ forward broadcasts:do not
Broadcast packet use __ on the network:resources
Broadcast packets make __ receiving host on the network __ the packet:every process
Broadcast traffic should be limited so that it __ __ adversely affect network performace:does not
Routers __ broadcast domains:separate
Because routers __ broadcast domains, __ networks can improve network performance by __ excessive broadcast traffic:separate subdividing eliminating
In addition to the 255.255.255.255 boradcast address, each network has a __ __:broadcast address
A network broadcast address is a called a __ __:directed broadcast
To send data to all hosts in a network, a host can send a single packet that is addressed to the __ __ of that network:boradcast address
Because of security concerns, directed broadcasts are __ __ by default:turned off
CISCO global config command to turn off directed broadcasts, __ __ __-__: no ip directed-broadcasts
***11.3 - Public & Private IPv4 Address***:ok
Addresses which are globally routed between ISP routers are called, __ __ __:public ipv4 addresses
Blocks are addresses which are used by internal hosts are called, __ __ __:private ipv4 addresses
Private Addresses are defined in __ __:rfc 1918
Private Addresses are sometimes referred to as __ __ __ __:rfc 1918 address space
Class A private Address Range, _._._._ to _._._._:10.0.0.0 10.255.255.255
Class B private Address Range, _._._._ to _._._._:172.16.0.0 172.31.255.255
Class C private Address Range, _._._._ to _._._._:192.168.0.0 192.168.255.255
Private Addresses are not __ __:globally routable
The IETF does not consider __ IPv4 ADDR or __ as effective security measures:private NAT
There are certain address such as __ ADDR & __ ADDR that cannot be assigned to hosts:network broadcast
Special Address used by a host to direct traffic to itself, __ address:loopback
Loopback address range _._._._ to _._._._ or more commonly identified as _._._._:127.0.0.0 127.255.255.254
Loopback Addresses can be used to test __/__ configuration is operational:tcp/ip
(ACRONYM) APIPA:automatic private ip addressing 
APIPA is more commonly known as __ __ or as _-_ addresses:link local self-assigned
Link Local address range _._._._ to _._._._:169.254.0.1 169.254.255.254
Link Local Addresses are used by __ __ client to __-__ in the event that there are no DHCP servers avail:windows DHCP self-configure
Designed to support extremely large network w/more than 16,000,000 hosts, __ __:class a
Class A address range _._._._/_ to _._._._/_:0.0.0.0/8 127.0.0.0/8
Designed to support moderate size networks with approx 65,000 hosts, __ __:class b
Class B address range _._._._/_ to _._._._/_:128.0.0.0/16 191.255.0.0/16
Designed to support small networks with 254 hosts, __ __:class c
Class C address range _._._._/_ to _._._._/_:192.0.0.0/24 223.255.255.0/24
Class D __ block _._._._ to _._._._:multicast 224.0.0.0 239.0.0.0
Class E __ block _._._._ to _._._._:experimental 240.0.0.0 255.0.0.0
Classful addressing has been replaced with __ addressing:classless
Classless addressing __ the rules of class (A,B,C):ignores
Public IPv4 network Addresses are allocated based on the __ of __ that can be __:number addresses justified
IPv4 & IPv6 addresses are managed by the __ __ __ __:internet assigned numbers authority
__ manages are allocates blocks of IP ADDR to the __ __ __:regional internet registries
There are __ Regional Internet Registries (RIR):5
*** 11.4 - Network Segmentation***:ok
In an Ethernet LAN, devices use __ & __ to locate other devices:broadcasts arp
ARP sends layer 2 __ to a __ IPv4 ADDR on the __ network to discover the associated __ ADDR:broadcasts known local mac
Switches __ broadcasts out __ interfaces __ the interface on which it was __:forward all except received
Routers __ __ __ broadcasts:do not forward
When a router receives a broadcast is __ __ forward it out other interfaces:does not
Therefore, routers __ broadcast __:segment domains
Therefore, each router interface __ to a broadcast domain:connects
Broadcasts are only __ within that specific broadcast domain:forwarded
A Large Broadcast domain is a network that __ many __:connects hosts
A problem with large broadcast domains is that these hosts can generate __ broadcasts:excessive
Excessive broadcasts can result in __ network operations:slow
The solution is reduce the size of the network to create smaller broadcast domains, process called, __:subnetting
The basis of subnetting is using __ bits to create additional __:host subnets
Subnetting __ overall network traffic & __ network performance:reduces improves
Subnetting enables Admins to implement __ __:security policies
Subnetting also __ number of devices by affected misconfigurations, mal intent, harware problems:reduces
