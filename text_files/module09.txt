**ADDRESS RESOLUTION**:ok
MAC Address, aka, __ address is used for __ to __ communication on SAME ETHERNET NETWORK:physical nic nic
IP address, aka, __ address used to send packet from __ device to __ device, on same or remote network:logical source destination
When the destination IP ADDR is on a remote network, the destination MAC will be the __ __:default gateway
Routers examine the __ IPv4 ADDR to determine the best __ to __ the IPv4 packet:destination path forward
When the router receives the Ethernet Frame, it _-__ the Layer __ information:de-encapsulates 2
Using the __ IPv4 ADDR, the router determines the __-__ device & then __ the IPv4 packet with new __ __ frame:destination next-hop encapsulates data link
The frame is __ to the data link tech that is associated with that __:specific link
**ARP**:ok
For IPv4 packets, MAC-IP matching is done with _ _ _:address resolution protocol
For IPv6 packets, MAC-IP matching is done with _ _ _:icmpv6 neighbor discovery
IPv4 ARP provides 2 functions, _-_ mapping & __ __:MAC-IP arp table
Packet is sent to data link layer to be __ in Ethernet Frame:encapsulated
The device refers to a __ stored in __ to the find the __ address the is mapped to the __ address:table memory mac ipv4
If packet destination IPv4 is on same network as source IPv4 addr, devices searches __ table for __ IPv4 addr:arp destination
If packet destination IPv4 is on different network as source IPv4, device search __ table for IPv4 of __ __:arp default gateway
If device located IPv4 in its ARP table, its corresponding __ addr is used as the __ MAC address in the frame:mac destination
If device DOES NOT locate IPv4 in arp cache, devices sends an __ __:arp request
__ __ sent when device needs to know MAC that is associated with IP & DOES NOT have entry in arp table:arp request
ARP messages are encapsulated direclty within __ __:ehternet frame
There is no __ __ in arp requests:ipv4 header
ARP REQUEST destination MAC address, __-__-__-__-__-__:ff-ff-ff-ff-ff-ff
ARP REQUEST source MAC address is MAC address of __ of the ARP request:sender
ARP REQUEST TYPE FIELD is ___:0x806
Because ARP requests are __, they are flooded out __ ports, except __ port:broadcasts all receiving
__ Ehternet NICs on LAN process the broadcasts:all
All Ethernet NICs must deliver ARP request to __ __ for processing:operating system
A Router (wil/will not) __ forward the broadcasts out other interfaces:will not
Only __ device on the LAN will have an IP that matches the target IP in the ARP request:1
All other devices (wil/will not) __ relpy:will not
ARP REPLY destination MAC address is MAC address of __ of ARP __:sender request
ARP REPLY source MAC address is MAC address of __ of ARP __:sender reply
ARP REPLY TYPE FIELD is __:0x806
__ the device that originally sent the ARP REQUEST will receive the __ ARP REPLY:only unicast
If no device responds to the ARP REQUEST, the packet is __, b/c a frame cannot be created:dropped
Each Device uses an ARP __ __ to remove ARP entries that have not been used for specified amount of time:cache timer
COMMAND CISCO, display ARP table _ _ _:show ip arp
COMMAND WINDOWS, display arp table __ -_:arp -a
As a __ frame, an ARP REQUEST is received & processed by every device on the LOCAL network:broadcast
With a Large network, lots of devices all accessing the network at the same time could case some __ in performance:reduction
A threat actor could use ARP __ to perform an ARP __ __:spoofing poisoning attack
DAI:dynamic arp inspection
enterprise level switches use _ _ _ to mitigate arp poisoning attacks:dynamic arp inspection
**ICMPv6 NEIGHBOR DISCOVERY**:ok
IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol is referred to as __ or ___:nd ndp
ND provides __ __, __ __ & __ services:address resolution router discovery redirection
ND uses __ to do this:IMCPv6
ICMPv6 ND uses __ types of messages to perform address resolution, router discovery & redirection:5
These messages are __ __, __ __, __ __, __ __, __:neighbor solicitation neighbor advertisement router solicitation router advertisement redirect
__ __ & __ __ are used for address resolution:neighbor solicitation neighbor advertisement
__ __ & __ __ are used for router discovery & SLAAC:router solicitation router advertisement
__ is used to notify router of better __-__ selection:redirection next-hop
ICMPv6 Neighbor Solication messages are sent using special Ethernet & IPv6 __ addresses:multicast
__ addresses allow Ethernet NIC of receiving device to determine if msg is for __ without involving the __:multicast itself os
